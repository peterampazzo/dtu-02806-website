There are a lot of opinions on what is best for kids? From parents trying to educate them to politicians defining the educational system. But what actions will help shape a happy and healthy society? And how can we improve children's well-being? 

Trying to answer this question, we had a wild idea: Let the kids speak up. Let's try to understand their thoughts. Luckily, we were not the first ones. A survey was made in Barcelona to almost 4000 kids asking questions about their well being [2017 Subjective Child Welfare Survey](https://w10.bcn.es/APPS/riswestudis/documentacio.do?reqCode=mostrarImatge&idDoc=10447). 
The study results were interesting but difficult to interpret and could benefit from additional visualizations and a different presentation mode. So, we decided to work on a visualization that would allow the data to speak for itself. We set the focus on answering: How do kids from different neighbourhoods perceive their welfare?
The idea is to merge the subjective perceptions of the kids (for example, how bored they feel?) with facts about the neighbourhood. Hopefully, we will identify patterns that will help us understand how to help kids feel happier.
