Here a wild idea: Let the kids speak up. Let's try to understand their thoughts. 

Luckily, we were not the first ones. A survey was made in Barcelona to almost 4000 kids asking questions about their well being [2017 Subjective Child Welfare Survey](https://w10.bcn.es/APPS/riswestudis/documentacio.do?reqCode=mostrarImatge&idDoc=10447). 
The study results were interesting but difficult to interpret and could benefit from additional visualizations and a different presentation mode. So, we decided to work on a visualization that would allow the data to speak for itself. We set the focus on answering: **How do kids from different neighbourhoods perceive their welfare?**
The idea is to merge the subjective perceptions of the kids with facts about the neighbourhood. Hopefully, we will identify patterns that will help us understand how to help kids feel happier.
