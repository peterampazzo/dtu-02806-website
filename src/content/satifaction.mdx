# Exploring Life Satisfaction

Instead of looking at the feelings, it is as well possible to evaluate the children's perception towards _life satisfaction_. 
The survey includes the question: "To what extent are you satisfied with your life? 
Where kids can answer by marking a level between 0 to 10, with 0 being "Not at all" and 10 "Completely Satisfied". 

To evaluate the children answers the factors have been aggregated in 4 levels: "Very", "Fairly", "Slightly" and "Not at all". 
When an answer is not provided it is considered as "NC".

To evaluate how different plots impact the _life satisfaction_, it is possible to plot it against different variables. 
Let's start by looking at the different neighbourhoods.


<Bar />


_Sant Andreu_ and _Ciutat Vella_ are the two districts with the lowest ratio of kids "very" Satisfied with their life.  
It is interesting to observe that they also were the two districts with the highest ratio of _boredom_. 
This might indicate a relation between life satisfaction and the boredom experienced. 
Furthermore, _Sarri√†-Sant Gervasi_ is the district with the highest ratio of kids "very" satisfied, indicating the beforementioned connection with income. 

To investigate the relation with the income, we can evaluate the results for the neighbourhoods groups in the variable `'ERFDbllp'`. 
Even if these levels would represent different categories in each district, evaluating them can help clarify the relation with the income:


** NEED PLOT **


By looking at the figure we can conclude, that is possible to observe a decrease of the "very statisfied ratio" with the decrease of income. 
However, it is important to keep in mind that the neighbourhoods with the highest income have a lower representation.

To finalize the assesment of the income it is possible to examine the results of the question "How often are you concerned about the money your family has?". 


** MORE PLOTS **


Here, the same pattern is observed: The kids with a higher concern regarding money show the lowest ratio on life satisfaction. 
Looking at the distribution of the answer counts, it is possible to notice a tendency to mark "Sometimes" and "Never" over other levels.

It is interesting to observe how other variables behave as well:


** DID SOMEONE MENTION MORE PLOTS? **


The main point is that there is not a significant difference between genders. 
However, when looking at the age it is possible to see a slight decrease with growth. 
This could refer back to the before-mentioned "vital optimism-bias" and how, with the transition towards adolescence, the optimism starts to decrease.

It is interesting as well to asses additional attributes, such as if there is a difference for kids that have _learning difficulties_. 
In the survey the kids are asked to answer yes or no to the question: 
"Do you have a _learning difficulty_ such as: dyslexia, attention deficit disorder, hyperactivity or others?" 


** THE LAST PLOTS **


It is possible to observe that the satisfaction level is lower for the kids that have _learning difficulties_, 
almost 20% of them marked as "Fairly" satisfied and 10% "Slightly". 
However is important to keep in mind, that the proportion of kids that answer "Yes" or "Not sure" is extremely lower than the ones that answered "No".


# K-Means Clustering

So far several different attributes have been manually explored to see their impact on life satisfaction.
But we were curious to see if the data would have any underlying clustering, that wouldn't be possible for humans to see,
but maybe a machine learning model would be able to catch.

To explore that option, a K-means clustering model was created. The data was split into two categories, using the `SLSSmc` column.
The value in this column represented if the participants were: _"Very satisfied", "Fairly satisfied", "Slightly satisfied",_ or _"Not at all"_.
Here, one category would represent participants who were _"very satisfied"_ and all other options would be categorized as _"other"_,
in an effort to make the two clusters equal in size.

The data used in the model was a combination of all attributes investigated during the satisfaction analysis,
including columns as `Sexe` (Gender), `Edat` (Age), `ERFDbllp` (Type of neighbourhood), etc.
Additional columns were also added in an effort to include as much information as possible in the analysis.
Relevant columns were binarized or one-hot-encoded.

A K-Means model with two clusters was initialized using SKLearn. The data was then fitted to the model and labels from the clusters were generated.
Because K-Means model knows nothing about the identity of the clusters the labels returned might be permuted, thus it was necessary to match each learned cluster label with its true labels.

The K-Means clustering model accurately clusters our data, with an accuracy of $\sim 69.7\%$.
Looking at this number alone, makes it look like some kind of clustering is apparent, but it could be misleading.
The two categories created, had the following number of observations:

$$
\text{Very satisfied} = 2466,\ \text{other} = 1071.
$$

Then, with a quick calculation we observe:

$$ 
\frac{2466}{2466+1071} = 0.697
$$

Therefore, the accuracy achieved could, in reality, be the result of clustering all data points as a single cluster or, if two clusters are present,
both clusters consists of a majority of the _"very satisfied"_ category.
